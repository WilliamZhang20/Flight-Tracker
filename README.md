# Flight-Tracker

This project takes ADS-B signals from aircraft collected by an SDR (Software-Defined-Radio) then pushes the information to a database. The data can then be used in countless ways.
The main parameters that processed in this repository are the aircraft callsign, latitude, longitude, speed, and heading. 

## Getting started



## Future Updates

- A web app to see the flights on a map
- Front-end and back-end features to open the website from anywhere
