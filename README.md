# Flight-Tracker

This project takes ADS-B signals from aircraft collected by an SDR (Software-Defined-Radio) then pushes the information to a database. 
It will process the aircraft callsign, latitude, longitude, speed, and heading. 
Then, there will be a web app to allow the user to watch a map showing past recordings from my SDR in Ottawa.
